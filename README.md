Window Service Installation Steps
Follow these steps to install a Windows service:

Step 1: Get the Latest Project
Ensure you have the latest version of the Windows Service project you want to install.

Step 2: Build the Project
Build the Windows Service project to generate the necessary binaries.

Step 3: Locate the Service Executable
Check for the .exe file in the bin/Debug folder of your project. You'll need this file for installation.

Step 4: Open Command Prompt as Administrator
Navigate to "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319" in File Explorer.
Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run as administrator" to open an elevated Command Prompt.

Step 5: Install the Windows Service
In the Command Prompt, run the following command:
  installutil -i "Path_to_Your_WindowService_EXE"


Replace "Path_to_Your_WindowService_EXE" with the actual path to your service executable.
Step 6: Verify Service Installation

To check if the service is installed correctly, press Windows + R to open the Run dialog.
Type services.msc and hit Enter to open the Services management console.
Look for your service in the list of services. If it's there, it means the installation was successful.
Step 7: Start the Service

Find your service in the list of services, right-click on it, and select "Start" to begin running the service.
Step 8: Test the Service

To test if the service is working, create a text file named "TempTest.txt" in an accessible location.
If the service is functioning correctly, this file should open or be manipulated as per your service's functionality.
Please note that this README assumes you have the necessary permissions to install and manage Windows services. Additionally, ensure you have a backup of your database for sample testing before installing the service, as some services may interact with databases.

For any specific configuration or setup instructions related to your Windows service or database, refer to the project documentation or consult with the developers or administrators responsible for the service.
